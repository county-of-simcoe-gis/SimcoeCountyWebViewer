# Simcoe County OpenLayers Map Viewer

## Live site can be found [here](https://opengis.simcoe.ca/public)

Please visit our release page for stable downloads. [Releases](https://github.com/county-of-simcoe-gis/SimcoeCountyWebViewer/releases)

This site has officially went live as a production release on Mar 22nd, 2021.

This app is built using React, OpenLayers and GeoServer. Many components are configurable to point to your own WMS/WFS, XYZ services. Some components use a custom rest api, such as the search and property report.

It's built using a framework to easily create your own tools and themes (instructions below) using the provided templates. Control what layers, tools and themes are loaded using the config at the root of the src folder.

The Table of Contents (layers tab) utilizes groups in GeoServer.

Contributions are welcome. Even if you only clone it and add tools to your own project, please share them back and I'll integrate them if useful.
